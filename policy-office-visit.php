        </div><br>
        <p>All patients will be required to present a photo ID, their current medical insurance card and deductible and co-pay payments at every office visit. If your insurance requires authorization number or referral, please be sure your primary care physician has obtained one for you or your appointment will be rescheduled.</p><br>
        <p>Patients without verifiable health insurance will be required to demonstrate a form of payment before being seen.</p><br>
        <p>Please arrive 20 minutes early to check in with receptionist and the nurse. Your appointment time is the time you see the provider, not the time you arrive. We want to make your appointment informative and efficient. During your consultation, we will review your medical history, perform a physical exam and discuss your goals. We encourage you to make a list of questions.</p><br>
        <p>Before your appointment, please complete and return all paper work from our office, provide us with any previous diagnostic imaging, labs, PFT, or sleep study reports, and any previous medical records from other pulmonary providers.</p><br>
        <p>We ask that you and anyone coming to the office with you, not to use perfume, cologne or scented lotion. We also ask that you and anyone coming with you to the office not smell of cigarette smoke. Please do not smoke 4 hours prior to your appointment.</p>
