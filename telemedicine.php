        <p>In an effort to help reduce the spread of the Corona or COVID-19 virus, Medcorps is now taking Telemedicine appointments. Telemedicine holds the promise to significantly impact some of the most challenging problems of our current healthcare crisis. Although an annual in-person visit is necessary in order for us to maintain a doctor-patient relationship with you, through Telemedicine we can continue to serve the needs of the patient. Telemedicine is also a great option for some individuals unable to travel. Give us a call today to set up your telemedicine appointment.</p><br>
