        </div><br>
        <p>Trained service animals, whether accompanied by individuals with disabilities or by trainers of service animals, are permitted in Medcorps Asthma and Pulmonary Specialists Offices, in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) and applicable state law. We intend that the broadest access be provided to service animals and persons using service animals, and trainers of service animals, be afforded independent access to Medcorps Asthma and Pulmonary.
            In the event a patient or staff member is allergic to or has a phobia about animals, consideration will be made on a case by case basis in planning for the care of a patient who has need of a service animal. Accommodations will be made but these are not valid reasons for denying access or refusing services to patients with disabilities. All service animals must always remain on a leash and be appropriately controlled.Owners of service animals shall be liable for any harm caused by the animal to Medcorps Asthma and Pulmonary Specialists, its officers, agents, employees, patients, and visitors. Pets or animals whose sole purpose to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as Service Animals under the American with Disabilities Act. Pets and comfort animals are not permitted in Medcorps Asthma and Pulmonary offices. </p>
