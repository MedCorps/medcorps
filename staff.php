            <h1>Dr. Peter J. Saccone - DO</h1><br>
            <p>I am very happy to be part of Medcorps and to have the opportunity to work in South Jersey. I attended Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine for both medical school and residency. I came to Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine and completed my fellowship in Pulmonary and Critical Care medicine. I have had additional training in the field of interventional pulmonology. These highly specialized skills allow me to diagnose lung cancer in its earliest stages, offering options, even cures, never before available. I was an assistant professor of medicine at Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine and continue to teach physicians of all skill levels. I live here in South Jersey, and love spending my free time with my beautiful wife and daughter. Additionally, I am the medical director at Underground Martial Arts and Fitness, where I have earned a Black Belt in mixed martial arts. I look forward to seeing you in the office!</p>
